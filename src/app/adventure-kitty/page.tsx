              Adventure Kitty, a brand focused on making high-quality cat accessories for the outdoors, came to me with a website that wasn’t living up to its potential. The navigation was confusing, the brand identity wasn’t coming through strongly, and the mobile experience made browsing and shopping frustrating. These issues left both the customer journey and the brand story underdeveloped.

            <p>
              The existing feel felt uninspired and lacked a storytelling that their social media already had. I researched other outdoors and pet accessory brands to see what worked in terms of color, typography, and page layout. From there, I created a variety of color palettes, typography patterns, and a vision board to explore a more bold, playful, and “outdoorsy” side to the brand that wasn’t really coming through enough.

            <p>With the brand strategy in place, I moved to the re-design:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Wireframes:</strong> Organized the hompage to prioritize key products and storytelling elements.</li>
              <li><strong>Mobile-first approach:</strong> Optimized the layouts for readbility on mobile devices, especially for the "testimonials" section.</li>
              <li><strong>Custom components:</strong> Created a playful marquee, carousel focusing on the development of the Meowcat harness, and an improved reviews section.</li>
              <li><strong>Product discovery:</strong> Created product grids on homepage and product pages.</li>
            </ul>
